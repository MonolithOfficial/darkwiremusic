        "description": "As stated above, Grave is one of the greatest Swedish death metal bands alongside our pick for #10. While listening to Grave, you will feel like you're in grave danger, indeed. You'd think the idea behind this band is pretty simple if we told you they started out in 1986 as Corpse, not more, not less. Straightforward, face-melting, unholy death metal is the genre. Grave's 1991 debut effort is the definition of staying true to the monolithic structure of death metal monstrosity. This band's earlier efforts sport a very primal-sounding production, which, quite frankly, sounds absolutely atrocious - in the best way possible, of course.",

        "description": "Don't tell us, you didn't see this one coming. If you've ever been interested in death metal, you've probably already heard about the \"Left Hand Path\" album and its absolutely mesmerizing title track. Formed in 1987, initially as Nihilist, Entombed went on to become one of the greatest death metal bands of all time due to their ability to combine groove, melody and fast-paced blastbeats so well. One main thing that Entombed made itself unique with in the early 90s was the so-called \"buzz saw\" guitar tone that would occasionally jump out of the blue and peel the skin off your face. Unlike most death metal bands, Entombed successfully branched out of its genre and established what's now referred to as \"Death 'n' Roll\", an ungodly mixture of, you guessed it, rock 'n' roll and death metal.",

        "name": "Mangled Torsos",
        "description": "Mangled Torsos is one of Germany's weirdest death metal bands. Honestly, it's very unlikely that you've already heard a death metal track featuring a freakin' acoustic guitar solo not during the intro, as you might've assumed, but right in the middle of it - out of nowhere. Funny thing is, on Mangled Torsos' first full-length effort entitled \"Drawings Of The Dead\" (1994), the title track contains a very thought-provoking, sentimental acoustic solo AND the heaviest, most brutal and merciless blastbeat you'll ever hear. A whole package, that is. Upon hearing the band's debuta LP, it'd be quite fair if you thought that the vocal style presented is quite a bit of an elephant in the room, since it's THAT low - the vocalist goes down to what sounds like C2 or even below that. However, please, don't misjudge and dismiss the record just because of that, for you'll miss out on an amazingly constructed, well-produced and creatively arranged, unique death metal album.",
